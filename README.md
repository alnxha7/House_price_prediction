# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION USING PYTORCH
This repository hosts a PyTorch implementation of a linear regression model aimed at predicting house prices. 
This project is designed to showcase a basic machine learning workflow from data preparation to training and making predictions.

## objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model using PyTorch that can predict house prices based on various features. 
This project aims to demonstrate the use of neural networks in regression problems, specifically in predicting real estate prices.

## Data
the data contains 1460 rows and 81 columns.The link for the data is given below

## Features and Data Preprocessing
The dataset may contain various features such as:

Basic features: square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms
Location-based features: neighborhood, proximity to amenities
Other features: age of the house, type of heating, garage size
Data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing data (imputation or removal)
Converting categorical data to numerical format (one-hot encoding or label encoding)
